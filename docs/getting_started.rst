Getting Started
===============

Here is how we create a new Django project quickly while letting cookiecutter_ to do all the work.

To get started we assume the following dependencies ::
    
    pip
    virtualenv/pyvenv/virtualenvwrapper
    PostgreSQL
    Bower

Get Cookiecutter ::

    $ pip install cookiecutter

Now run it against this repo::

    $ cookiecutter https://github.com/chrisdev/wagtail-cookiecutter-foundation.git

You'll be prompted for some values. Provide them, then a Django project will be created for you ::

Enter the project ::

    $ cd wagtail_project/

Create a git repo and push it there::

    $ git init
    $ git add .
    $ git commit -m "first awesome commit"
    $ git remote add origin git@github.com:cclarke/my_site.git
    $ git push -u origin master
    
To create your project's virtual environment, install all pip dependencies, create the development database, run migrations and load initial data to database, install front-end dependencies and finally start the development server for you run ::
